9. Create a computer program that performs the following steps:
Prompt the user for an integer and store the value in a variable.
Display the data type of the variable that holds the entered data.
Convert the value to an integer type and store the converted value in a new variable.
Display the value and type of the new variable in a single sentence. (For example, "The value is 8 with type integer.")
Run the program and enter a float value at the prompt. What is its value in the last step?
Refactor the program, using a float instead of an integer. What happens if you enter an integer rather than a float at the prompt?

integer_inp=input("Enter an integer: ")
print(type(integer))
integer=int(integer_inp)
type_int=type(integer)
print(f"the value is {integer} with type: {type_int}.")

# do not change the order in which the numbers and operators appear in the next line
result = 5 + 3 ** 2 * 9 
print(result) # the output should be 576

updated:
result = (5 + 3) ** 2 * 9 
print(result) # the output should be 576

11. Create a computer program that prompts the user for a float number and returns the integer portion of the floating number.

12. Write a computer program that calculates and displays the current value of a deposit for a given initial deposit, interest rate, how many times interest is calculated per year, and the number of years since the initial deposit.
The program should prompt the user for each of the values and use the following formula to calculate the current value of the deposit:
V = P(1 + r/n)^nt
where
V -- value
P -- initial deposit
r -- interest rate as a fraction (eg 0.05)
n -- the number of times per year interest is calculated
t -- the number of years since the initial deposit
The program should display each of the values entered to the user in a meaningful way (so that the user can easily see what each value represents), along with the results of the calculation.

p=input("Enter your initial deposit: ")
r=input("Enter the interest rate as a fraction (eg 0.05): ")
n=input("Enter the number of times per year interest is calculated: ")
t=input("Enter the number of years since the initial deposit: ")
try:
  p=int(p)
  r=float(r)
  n=int(n)
  t=int(t)
  v=p*(1+r/n)**(n*t)
  print("initial deposit:",p)
  print("interest rate:",r)
  print("number of times per year interest is calculated:",n)
  print("number of years since the initial deposit:",t)
  print("current value of your deposit:",v)
except:
  print("Please enter numerical values only!")

  print("simple interest for the life of the loan:",interest)
except:
  print("Please enter numerical values only!")


14. Create a computer program that displays three statements that evaluate to True and three statements that evaluate to False.
Example:

  print("a<b = True")
else:
  print("a<b = False")
if a>b:
  print("a>b = True")
else:
  print("a>b = False")
if a==b:
  print("a=b = True")
else:
  print("a=b = False")
try:
  a=int(a)
  b=int(b)
  print("a and b are both strings = False")
  if a+b>=10:

  print("a and b are both integers = True")

15. Create a computer program that prompts the user for a number and calculates the following:
the boolean of the number entered
the binary equivalent of the number entered
the square root of the number entered

The program should display the following to the user:
The number the user entered, in a phrase like, "You selected value."
The boolean of the number, in a phrase like, "The boolean of your number is value."
The binary equivalent of the number, in a phrase like, "The binary equivalent of your number is value"
The square root of the number, in a phrase like, "The square root of your number is value," with the value rounded to three decimal places.

import math
num=int(input("Enter a number: "))
bo=bool(num)
bi=bin(num)
sq=math.sqrt(num)
print(f"You selected {num}.\nThe boolean of your number is {bo}.\nThe binary equivalent of your number is {bi}.\nThe square root of your number is {sq:.3f}.")


16. Create a computer program that completes the following tasks:
It prompts the user for a series of 5 integers.
The user must be prompted for 5 numbers.
After the fifth entry, the program stops prompting for values and performs the following calculations:
the product of the integers
the average of the integers
the sum of the integers
After performing the calculations, the program should display the following to the user:
the values the user entered
each of the calculations, using a phrase that identifies the value

import math
num_list=[]
for i in range(5):
  inp=int(input("Enter an integer: "))
  num_list.append(inp)
product=math.prod(num_list)
su=sum(num_list)

Start with a street address that includes a building/house number, the name of the street, and the type of street (e.g., Street, Avenue, Boulevard, etc.).
You can use any address you wish and abbreviations are acceptable.
An example is 25 Main Street.
Display the full address to the user.
Display the house number only in a phrase like, "The building or house number is 25."
Display the street name in a phrase like, "The street name is Main Street."

num=input("Enter your building/house number: ")
street=input("Enter the name of the street: ")
ty_st=input("Enter the type of the street (e.g., Street, Avenue, Boulevard, etc.): ")
full_addr=f"{num} {street} {ty_st}"
print(f"Your full address is {full_addr}.")
print(f"The building or house number is {num}.")
print(f"he street name is {street} {ty_st}.")

----------------------
18. Collect the following individual pieces of data from the user:
First name
Last name
City where they live
Their hourly wage
The number of hours they work each week

Present the collected information based on the data input in a format like:
Hi, Firstname Lastname! How are you?
I hope the weather is nice in City.
Based on the information you provided, you earn X dollars per week, approximately Y dollars per month, and Z dollars per year.

Requirements:
Add your name and the current date in a comment on the first line.
The user can enter the text values using any case they wish, but the output must have only the first letter of each name and city capitalized.
For example, if the user enters john, JOHN, or joHn as their first name, the output should be John.
Assume that there are four weeks in each month, but the yearly calculation should be based on a full year.
Use correct spelling and punctuation in all user prompts and output.

#Karly 08/08/2022
firstName=input("Enter your first name: ")
lastName=input("Enter your last name: ")
city=input("Enter the city where you live: ")
wage=int(input("Enter your hourly wage: "))
hours=int(input("Enter the number of hours you work each week: "))
formattedFirst=firstName.capitalize()
formattedLast=lastName.capitalize()
formattedCity=city.capitalize()
weekSal=wage*hours
monthSal=weekSal*4
yearSal=monthSal*12
print(f"Hi, {formattedFirst} {formattedLast}! How are you?\nI hope the weather is nice in {formattedCity}.\nBased on the information you provided, you earn {weekSal} dollars per week, approximately {monthSal} dollars per month, and {yearSal} dollars per year.")

------------------
Conditional Statements
1. Write a program that asks the user how much money they have in their wallet. 
The program should output "You're rich!" if the user inputs $20 or more and "You're broke!" if the input is less than $20.
money=float(input("Enter the money you have in your wallet: "))
if money>=20:
  print("You're rich!")
else:
  print("You're broke!")

2. Write a program that performs the following steps:
Ask the user if they own any cats. (Yes/No answer)
Ask the user if they own any dogs. (Yes/No answer)
If the user responses indicate that they have both cats and dogs, output "You must really love pets!"
Otherwise, the output should be "Maybe you need more pets."
The last step will apply if the user has cats but not dogs, dogs but not cats, or neither cats nor dogs.

cat=input("Do you have any cats? (Yes/No): ")
dog=input("Do you have any dogs? (Yes/No): ")
formCat=cat.capitalize()
formDog=dog.capitalize()
if formCat=="Yes" and formDog=="No":
  print("You must really love pets!")
else:
  print("Maybe you need more pets.")

3. Create a computer program that asks the user a few questions to which the user will respond either True or False. 
Display all the questions with the correct answer and the user's answers at the end of the program, 
along with the user's the correct response rate (number of questions answered correctly/number of questions).
que1=input("pie=3.1415926535... (True/False): ")
que2=input("spider has 8 legs (True/False): ")
que3=input("there are 28 continents (True/False): ")
form1=que1.capitalize()
form2=que2.capitalize()
form3=que3.capitalize()
que1Ans="True"
que2Ans="True"
que3Ans="False"
cor_ans=0
if form1==que1Ans:
  cor_ans+=1
if form2==que2Ans:
  cor_ans+=1
if form3==que3Ans:
  cor_ans+=1
rate=cor_ans/3
print(f"Question1: pie=3.1415926535... Ans: {que1Ans})")
print(f"Question2: spider has 8 legs Ans: {que2Ans})")
print(f"Question3: there are 28 continents Ans: {que3Ans})")
print(f"Your answers: \nquestion 1: {que1}, question 2: {que2}, question 3: {que3}")
print(f"Your correct response rate: {}")


4. Write a program that uses elif to produce five different possible outcomes based on a single user input.

Ask the user what season it is (fall, winter, spring, or summer).
If the user enters fall, output "I bet the leaves are pretty there!"
If the user enters winter, output "I hope you're ready for snow!"
If the user enters spring, output "I can smell the flowers!"
If the user enters summer, output "Make sure your AC is working!"
If the user enters a value that does not correspond to a season, output "I don't recognize that season."
The user should be able to enter the name of the season in any case and the program will still work.

season=input("What season is it? (fall, winter, spring, or summer): ")
season=season.lower()
if season=="fall":
    print("I bet the leaves are pretty there!")
elif season=="winter":
    print("I hope you're ready for snow!")
elif season=="spring":
    print("I can smell the flowers!")
elif season=="summer":
    print("Make sure your AC is working!")
else:
    print("I don't recognize that season.")

Challenge: After you have the program working as describe above, modify the program so that the user can enter either "fall" or "autumn" and get the same result.

season=input("What season is it? (fall, winter, spring, or summer): ")
season=season.lower()
if season=="fall" or season=="autumn":
    print("I bet the leaves are pretty there!")
elif season=="winter":
    print("I hope you're ready for snow!")
elif season=="spring":
    print("I can smell the flowers!")
elif season=="summer":
    print("Make sure your AC is working!")
else:
    print("I don't recognize that season.")

Self-Assessment: Conditional Statements
Your company has organized a morale event! They're hosting a picnic and field day in the park, and of course, they want to play games! Team games! Team building games!
To do that they want to assign the attendees to certain teams based on their last name. They've already chosen the team names, but they want you to write a program that will sort each person into the correct team.
Here are the specs:
If a person's name starts with A, B, C, or D, then they are on the team "Red Dragons"
If the name starts with E, F, G, or H, they are on the team "Dark Wizards."
If the name starts with I, J, K, or L, they are on the team "Moving Castles."
If the name starts with M, N, O, or P, they are on the team "Golden Snitches"
If the name starts with Q, R, S, or T, they are on the team "Night Guards."
If the name stars with U, V, W, X, Y, or Z, they are on the team "Black Holes."

Here's an example of the output:
What's your last name? Weasley
Aha! You're on the team "Black Holes"!
Good luck in the games!
The example uses the person's last name, but you can choose to use first name if you prefer. You may also use a different output message as long as it clearly states what team the person is on.

#Karly 08/08/2022

coffee shop:
Write a program that will calculate the cost of a custom cup of coffee at a gourmet coffee shop, based on the size of the cup, the type of coffee selected, and flavors that can be added to the coffee. It should complete the following steps:
Ask the user what size cup they want, choosing between small, medium, and large.
Ask the user what kind of coffee they want, choosing between brewed, espresso, and cold brew.
Ask the user what flavoring they want, if any. Choices include hazelnut, vanilla, and caramel.
Calculate the price of the cup using the following values:
Size:
small: $2
medium: $3
large: $4
Type:
brewed: no additional cost
espresso: 50 cents
cold brew: $1
Flavoring:
None: no additional cost
All other options: 50 cents
Display a statement that summarizes what the user ordered.
Display the total cost of the cup of coffee as well as the cost with a 15% tip, in phrases that explain the values to the user. Round the cost with tip to two decimal places.
For example, if the user asks for a medium-sized espresso with hazelnut flavoring, the total should be $4; the total with a tip should be $4.60.

Sample Output
Do you want small, medium, or large? small
Do you want brewed, espresso, or cold press? espresso
Do you want a flavored syrup? (Yes or No) yes
Do you want hazelnut, vanilla, or caramel? vanilla
You asked for a small cup of espresso coffee with vanilla syrup.
