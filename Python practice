4. fix error(s) from below:
# display the text in quotation marks to an output block
Print("Python is fun!")
should be: print("Python is fun!")


# Display the text in quotation marks to an output block 
# without moving any of the existing acode to a different line
print("Python is fun!") print("Python is also easy.")
should be:
print("Python is fun!", end="") 
print("Python is also easy.")

# Display the text in quotation marks to an output block 
# without moving any of the existing code to a different line
print 
("Python is fun!")
should be: print("Python is fun!", end="")

# Change each variable name to an appropriate name for Python. 
# Do not use the same variable name more than one time.
1-name = "Rebecca" # first name
&_name = "Roberts" # last name

should be: 
first_name = "Rebecca" # first name
last_name = "Roberts" # last name
 
# After changing the variable names, update the code below 
# to print out each name.
print(1-name)
print(&_name)

should be:

print(last_name)

5. Starting with the code blocks provided below, add to the code as needed to follow the instructions in the comments. 
You may add necessary code, but you should not delete any of the existing code. 
Run each block to make sure it works as expected before going to the next block.

# Add a new line of code that displays the text in quotation marks 
# to an output block without repeating the text in quotation marks.
output = "I love Python!"
add: print(output)
 
# your code below this line
# Display only the text Python is fun! to an output block 
# without deleting any of the existing code
print("Python is fun!")
#print("Python is also easy!")
added "#" in front of print("Python is also easy!")

6. Create a script that prompts the user for the name of the state where they were born and the name of the state where they live now. 
Save each value in its own variable and display the input values to the user.
born_state=input("Enter the state where you were born: ")
live_state=input("Enter the state where you live now: ")
print(f"You were born in {born_state} and you live in {live_state} now.")

--------------------
7. Write a script that meets the following requirements:
Add your name and the current date in comments at the top of the script.
Prompt the user to enter their first name, their last name, their phone number, and the year they were born. Save each of these values to a different variable.
Display the values they entered.
Test your script to make sure it works as expected.
#Karly 08/08/2022
first_name=input("Enter your first name: ")
last_name=input("Enter your last name: ")
phone_number=input("Enter your phone number: ")
year_born=input("Enter the year you were born: ")
print("first name:", first_name)
print("last name:", last_name)
print("phone number:", phone_number)
print("year of birth:", year_born)

-------------------
8. Create a computer program that performs the following steps:
Prompt the user for an integer and store the value in a variable.
Display the data type of the variable that holds the entered data.
Convert the value to an integer type and store the converted value in a new variable.
Display the value and type of the new variable in a single sentence. (For example, "The value is 8 with type integer.")
Run the program and enter a float value at the prompt. What is its value in the last step?
Refactor the program, using a float instead of an integer. What happens if you enter an integer rather than a float at the prompt?

integer_inp=input("Enter an integer: ")
print(type(integer))
integer=int(integer_inp)
type_int=type(integer)
print(f"the value is {integer} with type: {type_int}.")

9. Update the code below so that the result is equal to 576. Do not change any of the existing values or operators or the order in which they appear.
# do not change the order in which the numbers and operators appear in the next line
result = 5 + 3 ** 2 * 9 
print(result) # the output should be 576

updated:
result = (5 + 3) ** 2 * 9 
print(result) # the output should be 576

10. Create a computer program that prompts the user for a float number and returns the integer portion of the floating number.
float_num = input("Enter a float number: ")
try:
  float_num=float(float_num)
  converted_int = int(float_num)
  print(converted_int)
except:
  print("Please enter a decimal number.")
  
11. Write a computer program that calculates and displays the current value of a deposit for a given initial deposit, interest rate, how many times interest is calculated per year, and the number of years since the initial deposit.
The program should prompt the user for each of the values and use the following formula to calculate the current value of the deposit:
V = P(1 + r/n)^nt
where
V -- value
P -- initial deposit
r -- interest rate as a fraction (eg 0.05)
n -- the number of times per year interest is calculated
t -- the number of years since the initial deposit
The program should display each of the values entered to the user in a meaningful way (so that the user can easily see what each value represents), along with the results of the calculation.

p=input("Enter your initial deposit: ")
r=input("Enter the interest rate as a fraction (eg 0.05): ")
n=input("Enter the number of times per year interest is calculated: ")
t=input("Enter the number of years since the initial deposit: ")
try:
  p=int(p)
  r=float(r)
  n=int(n)
  t=int(t)
  v=p*(1+r/n)**(n*t)
  print("initial deposit:",p)
  print("interest rate:",r)
  print("number of times per year interest is calculated:",n)
  print("number of years since the initial deposit:",t)
  print("current value of your deposit:",v)
except:
  print("Please enter numerical values only!")
  
  
12. Write a computer program that prompts the user for a principal amount, the rate of interest, 
and the number of days for a loan and then calculates and returns the simple interest for the life of the loan. 
Use the formula: interest = principal * rate * days / 365
p=input("Enter the principal amount: ")
r=input("Enter the interest rate as a fraction (eg 0.05): ")
n=input("Enter the number of days for the loan: ")
try:
  p=int(p)
  r=float(r)
  n=int(n)
  interest=p*r*n/365
  print("simple interest for the life of the loan:",interest)
except:
  print("Please enter numerical values only!")


13. Create a computer program that displays three statements that evaluate to True and three statements that evaluate to False.
Example:
a = 0
b = 1 
Output: a < b = True

a=0
b=1
if a<b:
  print("a<b = True")
else:
  print("a<b = False")
if a>b:
  print("a>b = True")
else:
  print("a>b = False")
if a==b:
  print("a=b = True")
else:
  print("a=b = False")
try:
  a=int(a)
  b=int(b)
  print("a and b are both strings = False")
  if a+b>=10:
    print("a+b<10 = False")
  else:
    print("a+b<10 = True")
  if a+b<=10:
    print("a+b>10 = False")
  else:
    print("a+b>10 = True")
except:
  print("a and b are both integers = True")

14. Create a computer program that prompts the user for a number and calculates the following:
the boolean of the number entered
the binary equivalent of the number entered
the square root of the number entered

The program should display the following to the user:
The number the user entered, in a phrase like, "You selected value."
The boolean of the number, in a phrase like, "The boolean of your number is value."
The binary equivalent of the number, in a phrase like, "The binary equivalent of your number is value"
The square root of the number, in a phrase like, "The square root of your number is value," with the value rounded to three decimal places.
