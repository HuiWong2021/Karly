ER diagram = type of flowchart that illustrates how “entities” such as people, objects or concepts relate to each other within a system

well-designed ERD includes:
  The tables required by the database, including the name of each table;
  A list of fields contained in each table;
  Metadata about each field, including the name of the field, its data type, and whether or not it is nullable;
  Identification of all primary (PK) and foreign key (FK) fields;
  How each table is related to each other.

ERD never includes data – just a description of the kind of data that the table will hold. 
Often useful to have access to sample data sets, to help you identify what fields the ERD should include and what the appropriate data type is for each field.

relationships: one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many
> indigates many
| indicates one
o indicates optional (zero)

Any many-to-many relationships will be defined as two one-to-many relationships between three tables, using a bridge table to connect the original tables.
A many-to-many relationship, then, must include three separate tables: the two original tables and a bridge table. 
e.g. student and class are many-to-many relationship. can be broken down into 3 tables: student, class, and class enrollment.
